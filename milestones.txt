ðŸ“Œ Milestone 1: Core Project Initialization  
> *Goal: Set up the foundational structure, CLI, and core generators.*

Issues:  
- [ ] Set up project repository and structure *(Initialize repo, add .gitignore, README, license, etc.)*  
- [ ] Implement CLI entry point (`cli.js`) *(Set up Commander.js to handle user input)*  
- [ ] Create project initialization logic (`initializeProject`) *(Prompt user for project details and generate basic files like `package.json`)*  
- [ ] Generate project configuration (`config.json`) dynamically  
- [ ] Generate `.env` file from user input  
- [ ] Generate base folder structure (`folderFileGenerator`) *(Dynamically create directories based on user input)*

ðŸ“Œ Milestone 2: Essential File Generators  
> *Goal: Create dynamic generators for critical Express.js components.*

Issues:  
- [ ] Implement `configGenerator` to handle `.env`, `config.json`, and middleware settings  
- [ ] Develop `controllerFileGenerator` *(Generates Express controllers dynamically)*  
- [ ] Develop `routeFileGenerator` *(Creates Express routes and links them to controllers)*  
- [ ] Develop `modelFileGenerator` *(Dynamically generates Sequelize models and associations)*  
- [ ] Develop `migrationFileGenerator` *(Auto-generates migration files for database setup)*  
- [ ] Develop `seederFileGenerator` *(Handles database seeding logic based on models)*  
- [ ] Develop `middlewareFileGenerator` *(Supports route-level and global middleware setup)*  
- [ ] Develop `templateFileGenerator` *(For scaffolding view templates if needed)*  

---

ðŸ“Œ Milestone 3: CLI Prompts & Real-Time Generation  
> *Goal: Make file and folder generation interactive as users answer prompts.*

Issues:  
- [ ] Integrate real-time folder and file creation with user input  
- [ ] Enhance CLI UX with better prompts and validations  
- [ ] Implement GitHub issue tracking setup automatically on new projects *(Optional feature to auto-generate repo issues for project setup)*  
- [ ] Allow user to choose between `app.js` vs `server.js` during setup  

---

ðŸ“Œ Milestone 4: Enhancements & Utilities  
> *Goal: Improve developer experience with additional helpers and utilities.*

Issues:  
- [ ] Add utility functions for common middleware patterns *(e.g., request logging, authentication guards, error handling)*  
- [ ] Enhance error handling across all generators  
- [ ] Add an option to include authentication (`setupAuthentication` with JWT, OAuth, etc.)  
- [ ] Add API documentation generator (`apiDocsTemplate.js`)  
- [ ] Generate `README.md` dynamically based on user input  
- [ ] Implement database synchronization feature (`syncHandler.js`)  

---

ðŸ“Œ Milestone 5: Future Vision â€“ Extensibility & Automation  
> *Goal: Make XPRS even more powerful and adaptable for different use cases.*

Issues:  
- [ ] Introduce support for alternative ORMs (Prisma, TypeORM, etc.)  
- [ ] Extend CLI to support frontend frameworks (React, Vue, etc.) *(Optional for full-stack scaffolding)*  
- [ ] Implement a plugin system to extend features dynamically  
- [ ] Provide GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD automation *(e.g., auto-deploy Express apps to cloud providers)*  
- [ ] Add auto-documentation generator (Swagger, Postman collection)
